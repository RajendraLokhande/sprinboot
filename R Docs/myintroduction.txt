project 2: Retail
C L I E N T -Edcon
D E S C R I P T I O N - Edcon Limited was a retail company based in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Its subsidiaries included Edgars, a department store with 203 branches.

Complete Your Draft for Coupen and Loyalty Point Terms and Conditions
-	We have created 3 APIs to implement this feature namely @PostMapping("/api/coupen") to save the draft, 
	@GetMapping("/{id}") to get the saved draft and @PutMapping("/api/coupen/{id}") to update the existing draft 
	i.e. (auto-save).
-	Our frontend application triggers an auto-save process at regular intervals or whenever there's a significant change.
-	Each time the auto-save is triggered, our frontend application sends an HTTP PUT request to the "/api/coupen/{id}" 
	endpoint with the updated draft content. The {id} parameter represents the draft's unique identifier.

    
How Loyalty points are get calculates ?

	Suppose if the customer bought a fridge and the warranty & guarantee is expired and
	the customer wants service for that ,then he or she can pay the service cost with the
	loyalty points they have .
	The Loyaly points are Calculated on the payble amount of customer. this payble amount we get from the Billing service 
	for that we have loyalty point interface  have method addLoyalty points as we create the Loyalty point impl
	class in that class we have field that mebember id ,loyalty point ,type of loayty point ,expiry date,active .

      Endpoints:

	->we have Create an endpoint(like @post(/{customerId}/service)) to initiate a service request
	, where the customer specifies the product (e.g., fridge) for which they need service.
	->Within this endpoint, you'll validate the warranty/guarantee status and loyalty points.
	->If the conditions are met, deduct the required loyalty points and update the service request status.
	If not, return an error message.

this loyaty point object is use for transfer of the data 

Customer have Field that contain the active CustomerLoyaty point Object field which contains the activeLoyalty Point queue 
and Inactive Loyalty point queue.  In Those queue conatins Loyaty point object date of expiry and no of loyalty points.
once scheduler start at night it remove the expired loyalty points based on the date for each customer also perform 
loyalty point inactive to active transformation.
