          Freight Booking ( I was working on this microservice )
          Entities ;
           * Shipment( Contains details such as origin, destination, cargo information, and special requirements.)
               1. Ship Management Service: This microservice allows port administrators to
                  manage and monitor the available ships, including their capacity and schedules. It

           * Carrier – (Contains information about the carrier's services, capabilities, and contact details.)
           * Booking – (Contains details such as the shipment ID, carrier ID, pickup and delivery dates, and any special instructions.)
           * Tracking – (Contains details such as the current location of the cargo, expected delivery time, and any status updates.)
               2. Tracking Service: Provides real-time tracking of ships and their cargo
                   We use AIS (Automatic Identification System)data, which is commonly
                   used for tracking ships , which has two sources like
                    AIS Receivers: Deploy AIS receivers or sensors in areas where you want
                    to track ships.
                    AIS Data Providers: APIs provided by AIS data providers, routes, and other relevant data to monitor
                   the location and progress of each ship.
           *  Cost Calculation Service: Calculates the transportation cost based on
               livestock type, route, and any additional charges. This service is essential for
               estimating the cost of each shipment.
           * Customer – (Contains information about the customer's contact details, billing address, and any preferences or requirements.)
